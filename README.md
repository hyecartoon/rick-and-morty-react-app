# Rick and Morty React application

This was a basic test to see how well I remembered React as it had been about 3 years since I used it. This took me around 4 hours to make. I could not believe how rusty I had gotten from simply not using the framework. Up until now the bulk of my work has been with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and NodeJS). It's about time I swap over to React as the workflow is much more reminiscent of how I used to use PHP back in the day, except significantly more modern and scalable.
